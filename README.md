Hi everyone, i was codding this a novel game i was planning to make, but since it's stuck on my pc for so long i decided to upload here i case someone needs.

The code is basically a way to create dialogues similar to those in novel games, where a character appers say something and give you some options for you to pick and change the history line.
I used as base the tutorials from this channel :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfLCzDzkvb0, then i modify some stuff to use with live2d models and the lines work in chain.

What i was plainning to do is use history_controller to have a timeline with diferent routes. The dialogues awnsers would increase a array for the points of each timeline.
I made it all in a way that you can ajust the timeline and dialogues using unity UI.


If you came from my youtube and just want to see more example of live2d check the "DialogueUI".


Not much though
